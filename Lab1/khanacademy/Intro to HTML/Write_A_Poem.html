    <h1>My Poem</h1>
    <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
    And sorry I could not travel both<br>
    And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
    And looked down one as far as I could<br>
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
    Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
    And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
    Though as for that the passing there<br>
    Had worn them really about the same,<br>
